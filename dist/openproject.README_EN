<p>
	Welcome to OpenProject! You'll find below a short guide to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
	After installation, your OpenProject instance should be available at https://domain.com/openproject/. It is already integrated with the UCS identity management. Users for OpenProject simply need to be activated within the user account settings in UCS. Afterwards, the user can login to OpenProject with his domain credentials.
